# InstaBot

Browser Automation is as interesting as it can be. It's my first project using Selenium.

If you want to see it's magic, You are just required to install [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) for your browser, and you're ready to go.

Run `bot.py`, after editing the `details.py` file.

A `data.csv` file will have following, followers, not_following_me_back and and i_am_not_following_back columns

It is inspired by a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2GBO_QjRlo) by ['Aaron Jack'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLEADhMcb8WUdnQ5_Alk7g).
